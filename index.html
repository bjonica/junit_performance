                    At this point in our reading, we should have a maintainable and testable design with readable and trustworthy unit tests; our builds might run remotely, and we are notified of failures; so, what is there left to gain by spending time on performance?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a delayed feedback loop means that we must wait a long time for tests to validate our progress. We can no longer monitor our tests because we lose track of our workflow staring at long terminal output.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if we just trigger a build in Jenkins and keep working, we end up creating trouble down the road by spotting problems late.

            <q>that's where the problem lies: our train of thought runs faster than our tests, and that difference creates a conflict</q>
            <aside class="notes">I really like this quote from the book, I think it sums a great deal of why having fast tests is important. Today's developer is very unlikely to be faced with strict hard drive, memory, or cpu constraints Generally, if tests started hitting any of these limits, we could easily throw more hardware at the problem; but, here we are: we have plenty of CPU cycles and disk operations to spare, but our productivity is constrained because this difference exists.</aside>

            <h2>The Need for Speed</h2>
            <p>A scenario:</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="fragment">
                    <p>The build takes too long, so developers run only a subset of tests locally before committing</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fragment">
                    <p>Developers let the build server run the full suite and switch tasks</p>
                </li>
                <li class="fragment">
                    <p>When the build finishes and something breaks, developers lose focus and task switch again</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="fragment">Slow tests eat away at productivity</p>
            <aside class="notes"><small><p>This, I think, is a very common scenario today; and its presence should be warning enough to justify improving speed</p><p>1. We don't get the full story, only a best-guess. Leaving tests for later implies only getting to fix things later. </p>
            <p>2. A context switch occurs as focus is shifted onto a different problem. Usually the build takes long enough to work on a new problem but not long enough to finish it</p>
            <p>3. Another context switch, as focus now has to be on fixing the old problem. Changing workflows is expensive, but you should know that already.</p></small></aside>

                <p>Tests that do not use many of the Base class's methods contribute to sluggishness</p>

If a test does not need all of the setup and teardown behavior provided by the base class, then the test should likely be inheriting from a different base class, or the base class should be refactored.</aside>

                <h5>How JUnit treats test class hierarchies:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before executing any tests in a given class, JUnit looks for any @BeforeClass annotated methods</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>...in the <strong>whole inheritance tree</strong>, with reflection</li>
                            <li>walks all the way up to <code> java.lang.Object</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before each @Test method, it does the same with @Before annotations</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After running each test, it does the same with @After annotations</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After running all tests in the class, it does the same with @AfterClass annotations</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>java.lang.Object obviously doesn't have any @BeforeClass annotated methods.</p>
                    <p>When scanning for @Before methods, it scans every superclass and executes all fo the setup methods found.</p>
                    <p>Every time you inherit from another class, that class's setup and teardown will be run alongside your own, whether or not they're needed. The deeper the inheritance tree, the more likely that traversal is wasting CPU time</p>
                    <p>even if only a small amount of time is wasted per test on this overhead, in a codebase with over ten thousand tests with builds that run many times a day, this will add meaningful time</p>

                <p>Fixes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prefer composition over inheritance</li>
                    <li>make use of Java's static imports
                    <ul><li>but Oracle warns: use them sparingly to maintain readable code</li></ul></li>
                    <li>use JUnit's @Rule feature to provide helper methods and setup/teardown
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes"><p>Composition makes it easier to change behavior on the fly with Dependency Injection and Setters. Inheritance is a very rigid construct -- generally you can only derive from only one type.</p>
                <p>Think of it this way, if a Type A wants to expose its complete interface of methods to Type B such that Type B can be used in place of Type A, then inheritance is the design pattern to use</p>
                <p>If, on the other hand, Type B only needs some specific behavior of Type A, then that indicates a need for composition. Use the Liskov Substitution Principle as a litmus test for determining a need for inheritance</p>
                <p>@Rules are flexible, a single @Rule (such as ExternalResource) executes code before and after a test method without having to use @Before and @After</p></aside>
