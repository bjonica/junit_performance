# Improving Test Execution Performance Presentation
## Effective Unit Testing Book Club

This presentation was created by myself using reveal.js and material from the Effective Unit Testing book by Lasse Koskela. This was my first time using reveal.js, and my first presentation. This was strictly targeted for members of the book club at my company.

Some additional information was gathered from StackOverflow, the JUnit javadocs, and various GitHub repos and maven plugin documentations.

It is unlikely that this presentation will be updated any further.
